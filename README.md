## Introduction
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial in reducing the mortality rate. This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the risk of a heart attack using patient health data. The objective is to build a model that can provide real-time predictions, helping healthcare professionals make better-informed decisions.

## Project Overview
This project consists of:
- **Data preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the clinical dataset for training.
- **Feature engineering**: Selecting the most important features that impact heart attack risk.
- **Model building**: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.
- **Model deployment**: Building a web application for real-time predictions using the trained model.

## Features
- Predict heart attack risk using clinical health indicators such as cholesterol, blood pressure, and other metrics.
- A user-friendly web interface for inputting patient data and receiving predictions.
- Models optimized through hyperparameter tuning to enhance accuracy.
